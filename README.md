- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jaloupera
- 👀 I’m interested in TSP problem
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python code but very very slowly (idle is a challenge, still I should write my Hello World! starting code, a pending jump), 2.7 under Windows XP that I'll never leave aside
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on strange fully deterministic ideas, which I need to pour into a set of codes to solve TSP
- 📫 How to reach me: I hope this page enables to send chat/brief messages to communicate each other
